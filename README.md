** Problem
Write a ruby program that accepts credit card numbers. Card numbers must be passed in line by line (one set of numbers per line)
The program should print the card in the following format "TYPE: NUMBERS (VALIDITY)"

** Environment
Developed on ruby-1.9.3-p125. Ruby 1.9 is needed because of syntax and minitest, small changes are needed for ruby 1.8

** Console
Run with `./main.rb` or `ruby main.rb`


** Test
Run only tests with `./test.rb` or `ruby test.rb`
